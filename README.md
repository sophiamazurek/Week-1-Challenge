# Week One Challenge

---

## Overview
Utalizing HTML and CSS I was able to go through and clean up a companies code. By doing this I allowed the software team to easily manage their code and function in a more friendly way. 

## Statment of Purpose
In this code I used semantic HTML practices to have the code follow an easy pattern to read. This also goes for the CSS and making sure that it is in order of how the cite is set up. Every image on this site will have alt text now so that we are abel to tell what it is. The last key change was that all the headers have descriptive titles and all follow in the semantic order.
